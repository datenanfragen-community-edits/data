        "Hi, my fb account was disabled today because Facebook says i have infringed its community standards by impersonating someone that i am not which isnt true. I have a barber page since 2013 and my very own personal account since 2009 with so many other accounts linked to my fb. \n\nPlease help me solve this issueâ€¦\n\n\n\nVarious privacy controls (including the ability to download your data as HTML or JSON) are available via the Facebook website: https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=your_facebook_information"
